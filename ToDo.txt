Testing:
- most importantly: Loading and saving files
- unit tests for each class (worth the effort or not?)

known bugs:
- loading files might produce errors due to syntax that was unaccounted for. further testing is needed.
- Tables that utilize TextFieldController.setLink() have inconsistent/confusing behaviour

nice-to-haves:
- more information for some parts of the UI
- TabEmergencies: it should not be possible to choose diseases that are set to non-existant
- custom campaign support
- save the last filepath into the executable instead of a separate file?
- block system access to current file (is this necessary? how is it handled by other apps?)
- make object cost and room cost editable
- illness ratios (how much does each illness appear in relation to others; if supported by the game)
- other missing parameters (although maybe not all should be added to avoid confusion)
- TabDiseases: if disease is set to non-existant, set the other fields to uneditable.
- textfields: option to reset to default value
- give warning when there is no way a disease can be cured? (also has to take into account sufficient diagnosis and MaxDiagDiff)
- should only ask for saving changes on exit if changes have been made.
- show current file on the window title
- save function (instead of just "save as")
- remembering language settings on next startup
- update readme with how to add new parameters and how to edit translations
- Gui could be split into GuiFrame, GuiReloader and GuiConfig
- Table could be refactored, using it feel more complicated than it needs to be.
